# Hay Bale Storage Calculator

A simple project to learn some basic React with TypeScript.

The uniform tab is very accurate for conventional size bales, however, the monopitch and gable roof tabs are making an estimation about how much volume is wasted up against the roofline. When a shed is larger, the estimation produced may be lower than what can be practically fit in the shed. In the future, I may implement a more accurate packing algorithm but this project was more about refreshing my react knowledge than anything else. The forms for each of the types of shed should be split into classes, I might do that in the future.
